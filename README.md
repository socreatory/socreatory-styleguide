# software-creators-masterclass-sg

This is the style guide for the Software Creators' Masterclass. It contains all UI components and documentation for how to use them.
The style guide is running on [aiur](]https://github.com/moonglum/aiur), a tool to generate style guides with a focus on pattern libraries. It is still work in progress and will be updated during the work on this style guide.

## Setup

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

In this directory run:

```
npm i
```

Now you need to run:

```
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:4001 to visit the pattern library.
